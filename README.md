# AVR_SWUART
Software UART(Software Serial) library for AVR

I modified software UART sources written by danni.<br>

Modified two things for better understanding.
1) Coding style (variable naming, macro, etc)
2) Add more comments

I tested this library on Atmega328p and it worked over baudrate 57600bps
