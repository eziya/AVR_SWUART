I modified software UART sources written by danni.<br>
https://community.atmel.com/projects/second-uart-software

Modified two things for better understanding.<br>
1) Coding style (variable naming, macro, etc)<br>
2) Add more comments<br>

I tested this library on Atmega328p and it worked over baudrate 57600bps<br>
